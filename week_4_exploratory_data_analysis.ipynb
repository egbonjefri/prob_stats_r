    "This is an unmarked optional tutorial to show the kind of thinking that goes into\n",
    "an exploratory data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial document is to walk through some of the common issues encountered\n",
    "in the early stages of an exploratory analysis on a set of data. It gives examples of common problem areas in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* reading in data\n",
    "* dealing with blanks\n",
    "* dealing with factors\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is a modified version of data from the New Zealand Election Survey, deliberately modified to introduce problems that occur naturally in many data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step One. Learn something about the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the New Zealand Election Survey takes place every three years as a postal survey of a sample of registered electors. Some sampled electors were part of a sample panel of people surveyed at the previous election as part of a longitudinal study, others were randomly chosen from the electoral roll. Those electors that were part of the longitudinal panel group were randomly selected in previous elections. \n",
    "\n",
    "As well as survey results, the data set includes information from the electoral roll, and weighting values for adjusting results. The full NZES data set has been reduced to a selected group of variables, making 3101 observations of 107 variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step Two. Contemplate some questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining the codebook (or in this case the appendix at the end of the document to check out the variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might decide that since New Zealand is a Mixed Member Proportional voting system, where people get to vote for both an electorate (local) representative and a nationwide political party, that it would be interesting to look at strategic voting under conditions where there are many political parties to choose from. We identify some relevant variables of interest in the data, and investigate the nature of the individual variables before we explore their interactions. The kind of variables they are is going to shape our question. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Read in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different kinds of data files in the world. Each one has its own issues when being read in by R. In this case the data is saved as a .RData file, which can be read in by using the `load()` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with most reading in file commands, inside the parentheses needs to go a piece of text, in quotes, that is the path to the file from the working directory (the working directory is the folder that R is currently paying attention to). The easiest way to get a R Markdown (Rmd) Document and console cooperating about this is to place the file with the data in it in the same folder as the R Markdown (Rmd) Document, open the R Markdown (Rmd) document in RStudio so we are looking at the contents of the document in the editing window, then in the RStudio Session menu, use the __Set Working Directory - To Source File Location__ command to make a common starting point. Then the code in the R Markdown (Rmd) document will use the same working space regardless of whether we knit the document or run code chunks in the Console. In this case, if the `nzes2011.RData` file is in the same folder as the R Markdown (Rmd) document, hence it can be read into R with the following command:\n"
